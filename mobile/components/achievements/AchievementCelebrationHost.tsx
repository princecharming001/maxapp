/**
 * AchievementCelebrationHost — fires the celebration the moment a badge is earned.
 *
 * The day-state endpoint (/schedules/active/full) returns `newly_earned_achievements`
 * exactly once, on the response where the badge was first awarded. This host
 * reads that query's cache (it does NOT drive fetching — Today/Home do), catches
 * the transient value, queues a CelebrationOverlay, and marks the badges seen so
 * it never double-fires. Mount once inside the authenticated app.
 *
 * Timing: the badge is captured immediately, but the overlay is HELD while the
 * user is in a focused flow (mid face-scan, onboarding, auth) so it never pops
 * over the camera. It appears once they land on a calm screen.
