Face landmark detection runs server-side on our own infrastructure using the MediaPipe Face Landmarker model. To produce natural-language feedback about a scan, we may send the face image and/or its derived measurement values to a large language model provider (currently Google Gemini; where configured, OpenAI) strictly for per-request inference; those providers act as subprocessors under their published terms and do not receive the data for training general models on our behalf.
