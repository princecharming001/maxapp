      weak: "Gets sore or tired pretty fast"
      painful: "It clicks or aches when I chew a lot"
    required: true
    why: "Sets masseter ramp pace and safety from actual jaw capacity, not whether they happen to chew gum. strong/average = start near standard cadence. weak = slow ramp from short sessions. painful = treat like TMJ and route to the safe ramp regardless of TMJ history."

  - id: heavy_screen_time
    question: "On a screen most of the day?"
    type: yes_no
    required: true
    why: "Heavy screen time means forward-head posture all day, so the schedule adds an extra midday mewing reset plus nasal-breathing checks."

    why: "Sets how much form coaching to layer in and how fast to stack sessions. none = week 1 is form check plus a basic morning hold, then build up. regular = skip the basics and add hard-mewing cues.

# Why BoneMax matters

Facial structure reads instantly, jawline angle, midface support, chin projection. Most adults can't change bone, but they CAN change posture, fascia tension, and muscle development around the jaw and neck, which shifts perceived structure significantly. Mewing trains tongue posture; masseter training thickens the jaw musculature; neck training holds the head up and back so the jawline stays sharp instead of soft.

The schedule is built from workout pattern + TMJ history + chewing experience + screen-time exposure. Those four answers decide how aggressive the masseter ramp is, where neck training plugs in, and how many midday posture resets are needed.

# Core protocol

## Mewing (3 sessions/day backbone)

- **Morning** at wake: tongue on palate (back third), lips sealed, teeth light touch, chin tucked. 60s active hold, then passive all day.
- **Midday** at midpoint(wake+15, bed−60): conscious 30s reset, tongue up, lips sealed, jaw unclenched, head over neck.
- **Night** at bed − 30min: night-set hold + sleep posture cues.

## Masseter / mastic

- 1× daily at user-set time (default wake + 2h). Single piece, 10-15 min, alternating sides.
- TMJ history → skip week 1, ramp from week 2.
- Rest 1 day/week.

## Neck training

- Workout days only: 5-8 min after workout (harness or banded 4-way).
- Non-workout days: chin tucks bundled into midday mewing.
- If user runs FitMax, BoneMax owns neck, FitMax should strip it from its session.

## Fascia / lymph

- Morning at wake + 20min: gua sha or facial massage 3-5 min. Stack after AM mewing.
- Evening at bed − 90min, 4-5×/wk: deeper fascia release. If on SkinMax, skip on retinoid or exfoliation nights.

## Bone-support nutrition (optional)

- Vitamin D3 (4000 IU) + K2 (100 mcg) with first fat-containing meal.
- Magnesium glycinate (300-400 mg) at bed − 60min.
- Calcium from food (greek yogurt, sardines, leafy greens), supplement only if dietary gaps.

# Notification cadence

- **Mewing morning reset** at wake.
- **Mewing midday reset** at midpoint(wake+15, bed−60).
- **Mewing night check** at bed − 30min.
- **Masseter session** at user-chosen time (default wake + 2h).
- **Facial fascia AM** at wake + 20min.
- **Nasal breathing check** at midday + 2h (twice/day if heavy screen time).
- **Neck training** at workout end + 15m on training days.
- **Fascia / lymph PM** at bed − 90min, 4-5×/wk.
- **Symmetry check** once daily, variable midday-evening time, rotating tip.

Quiet hours: nothing between bed and wake.

# Cross-module rules

- **+ FitMax**: BoneMax owns neck training. FitMax sessions strip neck.
- **+ SkinMax**: Skip evening fascia / lymph on retinoid or exfoliation nights.
- **+ HairMax**: Morning fascia / lymph stacks AFTER scalp minoxidil dries (15-20 min).
- **+ HeightMax**: Morning mewing + posture cues coordinate with height posture-reset task, render as one compound notification, not two.
