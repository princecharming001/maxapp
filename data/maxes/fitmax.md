# Why FitMax matters

Body composition is the foundation looksmaxxing rests on. Lean mass under thin skin reads as health, status, and discipline, every other module compounds on top of this. Fat distribution reshapes the face independently of skin or jawline work; gaining muscle changes posture and proportions in ways no haircut or skincare routine can.

The schedule is built from goal + experience + equipment + frequency. Everything else (training split, calorie target, conditioning load) derives from those four answers. Body-fat band and activity level refine the calorie math; injury history gates risky lifts.

# Core protocol

## Training principles

- Progressive overload is non-negotiable: when you hit the top of the prescribed rep range with good form, add 2.5-5 lb the next session.
- Stay close to failure on the last set of compound lifts (RIR 0-2). Earlier sets at RIR 2-3.
- Lateral raises and face pulls every session, regardless of split, small posterior delts and rear delts are aesthetics multipliers.
- Train neck 2-3×/wk via plate-loaded harness or banded resistance, UNLESS the user is also running BoneMax (in which case BoneMax owns neck and we omit it from FitMax).
- Compounds before isolation. Big rocks first.

## Nutrition principles

- Protein targets ~1g/lb bodyweight, regardless of goal.
- Calories adjust by phase: cut −500, lean bulk +250-300, recomp / maintenance @ TDEE, performance +100-200.
- No-track users get portion-based language: palm of protein, fist of carbs, thumb of fat per meal.
- Hydration: 0.5-1 oz per lb bodyweight per day, more on training days.
- Pre-workout: light meal 60-90 min out (protein + carb). Post-workout: protein within 60 min of finishing.

## Recovery

- Sleep 7-9 hr nightly. Schedule should include a wind-down cue at bed − 60 min on training days.
- Deload every 6-8 weeks (week of half-volume) for intermediates and advanced.
- One full rest day per week minimum, even on 5-6 day splits.

# Notification cadence

- **Pre-workout** at workout − 30m: hydration + light fuel reminder.
- **Workout window**: deterministic, user-set training time.
- **Post-workout** at workout end + 15m: protein reminder.
- **AM nutrition** at wake + 30m: protein-forward breakfast cue.
- **Midday tip** at midpoint(wake+15, bed−60): rotating motivational + technique cue.
- **PM nutrition** at bed − 2h: last meal anchor; protein + slow carb suggestion.
- **Weekly weigh-in** Monday at wake + 15m.
- **Monthly progress photo** 1st of month at midday.

Quiet hours: nothing between bed and wake.

# Cross-module rules

- **+ BoneMax**: BoneMax owns neck training; strip neck from FitMax sessions.
- **+ HeightMax**: After axial leg day, prepend a 60-90s dead hang to the post-workout block.
- **+ SkinMax**: Merge AM nutrition and AM skincare cues into a single block (cleanse → SPF → eat).
- **+ HairMax**: If on creatine, add the standard "creatine doesn't cause hair loss in users without genetic baldness predisposition" caveat once per cycle.
