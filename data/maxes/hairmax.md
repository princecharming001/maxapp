# Why hair matters for attractiveness

Hair is one of the highest-leverage aesthetic variables for men. It sits directly on the frame of the face, small changes in cut, length, or texture noticeably change how facial structure is perceived. The difference between average and put-together is often just the right haircut and a maintenance routine, not better genetics.

Most men who think they have "bad hair" actually have one of three problems: wrong cut for their face shape, poor side fullness, or no maintenance routine. The right haircut balances proportions, enhances bone structure, and makes daily styling easier.

## How hair frames the face

- Tighter sides → slimmer, more structured face
- Fuller sides → wider, softer
- More volume on top → vertical height, elongates face
- Fringes / curtains → shorten perceived face length

Same haircut looks great on one person, terrible on another. Goal: choose a style that balances your face shape, not chase trends.

## How hair affects perceived bone structure

Haircuts don't change bone, they change how it's perceived.

- Tighter sides → sharper jawline
- Texture on top → cheekbone definition
- Softer, fuller styles → reduce harshness on very angular faces
- Fringes → draw attention away from longer midface or forehead

# Common hair mistakes

**Wrong haircut for face shape.** Copying popular styles without considering proportions exaggerates flaws.

**Over-fading.** Tight fades sharpen structure but don't suit every face. Some shapes need medium/fuller sides for balance.

**Bad product use.** Wrong product or too much → flat, greasy, dull. Stacking products without washing builds buildup.

**Ignoring scalp.** Hair quality starts at the scalp. Dryness, dandruff, buildup → frizz, itch, poor texture.

**Aggressive towel drying.** Rubbing damages cuticle → frizz, breakage. Scrunch or pat instead.

**Letting cuts grow out too long.** Short cuts need trimming every few weeks; long needs shaping too.

**Describing instead of showing.** Stylists work visually. Bring 2–3 reference photos with similar hair type.

# Hair types, products, and routine

## Hair texture

**Straight**, lies flat, reflects light, can look shiny but flat. Oils travel down strands fast → gets oily quickly. Best with texture powder, clay, pomade. Layered cuts add volume.

**Wavy**, loose S-bends. Frizzy if dried wrong, loses definition if over-brushed. Best with sea salt spray, clay, pomade, leave-in.

**Curly**, defined spirals, naturally voluminous. Prone to dryness and frizz without hydration. Best with curl cream, leave-in, minimal brushing.

**Coily / kinky**, tight coils or a zig-zag pattern (Type 4), shrinks a lot when dry. The driest, most fragile texture, so moisture is everything: leave-in plus curl cream daily, and a light oil or butter to seal it in. Wash least often, co-wash between, and only ever detangle wet with conditioner. Never dry-brush.

## Products

**Texture powder**, volume + matte finish. For short, fine, or flat hair wanting lift. Avoid on very dry or curly hair.

**Clay**, natural hold, matte. Medium-length, structured styles, most hair types. Avoid very dry or extremely curly.

**Pomade**, hold + slight shine. Slick-back, controlled styles, medium-thick hair. Avoid fine hair or matte goals.

**Sea salt spray**, enhances waves, adds texture. Wavy hair, medium length, beachy looks. Avoid very dry hair (drying).

**Curl cream**, defines curls, reduces frizz. Curly, coily, and thick wavy hair. Avoid very fine hair.

**Leave-in conditioner**, hydration + texture. Almost everyone, especially dry, curly, coily, or long hair. Avoid overuse on very oily hair. Most versatile product.

## Daily styling routine

1. Start with clean or slightly damp hair.
2. Apply small amount of product (less is more).
3. Style with hands or comb.
4. Air dry or low heat.

Using too much product is the most common mistake.

## Wash frequency by hair type

- Straight: 2–3×/week (oils travel fast)
- Wavy: 2–3×/week
- Curly: 1–2×/week, midweek co-wash, weekend rinse
- Coily / kinky: 1×/week or less, co-wash between, condition every time

## Product rules

- Use small amounts.
- Wash out styling products every few days.
- Don't layer multiple products without washing.

Buildup → flat, flakey, greasy hair.

## Hydration

- Conditioner after every shampoo.
- Leave-in for ongoing hydration.
- Avoid excessive heat styling.

## Shampoo, conditioner, scalp health

Hair health begins at the scalp. Most "hair problems" are actually scalp problems, frizz, flatness, itch.

Sulfates can strip natural oils if too harsh, many benefit from gentler sulfate-free formulas. Parabens are preservatives; modern formulations often skip them.

Wash too often → dry scalp. Wash too little → buildup, dandruff. Most people do best with **2 washes per week** (adjusted by hair type and scalp state).

# Face shapes and haircuts

The right cut enhances your structure; the wrong one exaggerates imbalance.

Identify face shape from forehead width, cheekbone width, jawline width, overall length.

## Oval

Balanced proportions, slightly wider forehead than chin. Most versatile face shape. Best: textured crop, medium flow, slick back, quiff, taper fades. Medium side fullness. Avoid ultra-aggressive fades that distort balance.

## Round

Similar width and height, soft jaw, full cheeks. Goal: add vertical structure, reduce width. Best: quiff, pompadour, faux hawk, high-volume textured top, short sides. Tight sides reduce facial width. Avoid full sides, bowl cuts, straight fringe.

## Square

Strong jaw, wide forehead, angular structure. Already strong, add texture, don't exaggerate angles. Best: textured crop, side part with movement, short fades, crew cuts. Medium sides. Avoid extremely sharp fades.

## Rectangular / Oblong

Long face, straight cheeks, strong vertical length. Goal: reduce vertical, add horizontal. Best: curtains, textured crop, medium-length layered, natural flow. Fuller sides shorten the face. Avoid tall pompadours, high-volume tops, extremely tight sides.

## Diamond

Wide cheekbones, narrow forehead and jaw. Goal: balance upper face, soften cheekbones. Best: layered medium cuts, textured crops, side-swept fringe, flow styles. Medium-to-full sides. Avoid very tight fades.

## Heart

Wide forehead, narrow chin. Goal: balance the wider top with the narrower bottom. Best: medium textured, fringe styles, side-swept. Medium sides. Avoid extremely short sides (makes forehead look wider).

## Triangle

Wide jaw, narrower forehead. Goal: add volume to upper face. Best: medium-length textured, side-swept, volume on top. Medium sides. Avoid buzz cuts (emphasizes jaw).

The best haircut isn't the trendiest, it balances your face shape, works with your texture, and is easy to maintain.

# Hair loss and prevention

Hair loss is much easier to slow early than to reverse later. Many men ignore early signs and only act once significant recession or thinning has occurred.

## Early signs

- Receding temples (slow backward movement near temples)
- Thinning at the crown
- Miniaturization (thinner, weaker strands before disappearing)
- More visible scalp under bright light
- Excess shedding combined with thinning

When hairline shape or density changes, it's usually androgenetic (male pattern) hair loss.

## Recession patterns

- Temple recession (M-shape)
- Mature hairline (slight, stabilizes)
- Diffuse thinning across the whole scalp
- Crown thinning

Early identification → preventative treatments work much better.

## Treatments

Two categories: growth stimulators and DHT blockers. Most effective protocols combine both.

**Minoxidil**, improves blood flow to follicles, stimulates growth, increases thickness, slows loss. Topical (liquid/foam) or oral (low-dose Rx). For early thinning or recession. Caution if cardiovascular conditions or scalp irritation. Results take several months of consistency.

**Finasteride**, blocks testosterone → DHT conversion (the hormone shrinking follicles). Slows loss, preserves hair, improves thickness. Requires medical supervision. Some users report side effects, consult a doctor.

**Dutasteride**, similar but stronger. Blocks multiple forms of the conversion enzyme. For non-responders to finasteride. Always under medical supervision.

**Microneedling**, small needles stimulate scalp, improve circulation, increase topical absorption (especially minoxidil). Use with topicals for synergistic effect. Improper technique irritates, careful use required.

## Safety

Hair loss treatments affect biology, consult a healthcare professional before starting finasteride, dutasteride, or oral minoxidil. Individual responses vary.

# Facial hair and grooming

Used right, facial hair adds contrast, emphasizes strong features, balances the face. Used poorly, it highlights flaws.

## How facial hair changes structure

- Emphasizes jawline
- Adds contrast to lower face
- Draws attention to chin/mouth
- Reduces appearance of skin imperfections
- Balances proportions

Short beard → defined jaw. Goatee → projects a weak chin, adds contrast for poor zygomatic projection. Stubble → sharper features.

Poor maintenance does the opposite, looks unclean, immature.

## Shave vs grow

Density matters more than coverage. If facial hair doesn't grow evenly within 2–3 weeks, it'll look patchy. Sparse moustaches and incomplete beards make the face look younger. Clean-shaven or light stubble usually beats patchy.

## Beard styles by face shape

- Round: goatee, stubble with tight sides, short boxed beard. Avoid full cheek beards (widens face).
- Long/rectangular: light stubble, fuller cheeks, short beards. Avoid long chin-heavy beards.
- Square: short stubble, short boxed, natural shapes. Avoid extremely sharp lines.
- Weak jaw / soft lower face: goatee, goatee + stubble, short beard emphasizing chin.

## Goatee strategies

Goatees work for weak jaws, longer philtrums, weak chin projection. Shifts attention to the center of the lower face. Must be clean and intentional, not uneven.

## Shaving technique

1. Prep skin (warm water / post-shower), softens hair, opens pores.
2. Shaving cream or gel, reduces friction.
3. Shave **with the grain**.
4. Light pressure, short strokes.
5. Rinse with cool water.

## Tools

- Razor, closest shave, for clean-shaven looks. Irritation risk if misused.
- Electric trimmer, most versatile. Stubble maintenance, beard shaping, adjustable guards.
- Foil shaver, close shave with less irritation. Great for sensitive skin / razor bump prone.

## Preventing irritation

Causes: shaving against grain too aggressively, dull blades, too much pressure. Fixes: prep, clean blades, soothing post-shave products. Antibacterial or calming sprays help some.

## Neckline placement

Neckline sits about 1–2 fingers above the Adam's apple. Everything below gets shaved. A proper neckline prevents the beard from looking messy.
