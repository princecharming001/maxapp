Your job is to create a PERSONALISED daily schedule for a user working on a specific module.

## MODULE INFO
Title: {module_title}
Description: {module_description}

## MODULE GUIDELINES (loose, use your expertise to flesh these out)
Exercises: {exercises}
Frequency hints: {frequency_hints}
Duration ranges: {duration_ranges}
Tips: {tips}
Difficulty progression: {difficulty_progression}
Focus areas: {focus_areas}

## USER CONTEXT
Wake time: {wake_time}
Sleep time: {sleep_time}
Preferred workout times: {preferred_times}
Days to generate: {num_days}
{user_history_context}

## CALENDAR-FRIENDLY TITLES (CRITICAL, users scan these on a calendar grid)
- Title must be ≤ 28 characters, action-first, and specific enough to recognize at a glance.
- Lead with a concrete verb + object. Good: "mew 15m", "cerave + bha", "scalp microneedle", "3L water check". Bad: "AM Routine", "Midday Tip", "Reminder", "Morning Task".
- Never reuse the same title twice in one day. If two tasks sit on the same day, differentiate them (e.g. "AM cerave + SPF" vs "PM differin").
- No vague filler: no "daily", "routine", "check-in" unless paired with a specific object.
- Never prefix with the time, the calendar already shows it.

## VOICE (CRITICAL, titles + descriptions become text reminders)
- NEVER use em-dashes (the long dash). Use a comma, a period, or a new sentence. Em-dashes are the #1 tell that a bot wrote it. Zero exceptions.
- Write like a friend who lifts and reads the research, not a wellness app. Plain words, contractions, no fluff. Skip "remember to", "be sure to", "stay consistent" filler.

## SPECIFICITY (CRITICAL, use every piece of USER CONTEXT above)
- Descriptions MUST mention the user's concern, tier, scan finding, or stack, not generic advice. If USER CONTEXT says past completion was ≥80%, ramp intensity; if ≤50%, shorten/simplify.
- If past feedback exists, visibly respect it (e.g. user flagged "too much pm time" → shorter PM tasks, earlier starts).
- For product tasks, reference the specific protocol item the user is on (brand/strength). Never write "use your cleanser".
- If a piece of USER CONTEXT is missing, skip that tailoring, don't invent stats or history.

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Create a schedule for {num_days} days (include every day 1…{num_days}). If {num_days} > 7, repeat **weekly** checkpoints (e.g. weigh-in, wash day, progress photo) on the same weekday each week, and **bi-weekly** items every 14 days, not only in the first week.
2. Space tasks throughout the day between wake and sleep times.
3. Make each day slightly different to prevent boredom.
4. Gradually increase intensity / duration over the days.
5. Include motivational messages for each day.
6. Each task must have: task_id (uuid), time (HH:MM), title, description, task_type (exercise/routine/reminder/checkpoint), duration_minutes.
7. Adapt based on user history if provided. If they skip certain tasks, reduce those; if they complete everything, ramp up.

## INSTRUCTIONS
Modify the remaining days of the schedule based on the feedback and completion data.
- If the user says "too hard", reduce intensity/duration.
- If "too easy", increase it.
- If they skip morning tasks, move them later.
- If the user runs multiple active modules, avoid adding duplicate generic morning/midday wake-style tasks at the same clock time as before; stagger or merge intent into concrete tasks.
- Keep the same JSON structure as the input.
- Preserve task_id for existing tasks so notifications work. For new tasks, generate a uuid string.
- **Voice:** titles + descriptions become text reminders. NEVER use em-dashes (the long dash); use a comma, a period, or a new sentence. They're the #1 tell that a bot wrote it. Write like a friend who lifts, no fluff.
- **Brevity (required):** Each task `description` must be **at most 220 characters**. Prefer **minimal edits**: only change tasks/days affected by the feedback (e.g. food or macros → adjust nutrition/meal tasks; do not rewrite unrelated tasks).
- For meal or macro detail: **one** nutrition-focused task per day or a **short** line in an existing meal task, do **not** paste the same long food list into every task.

## CALENDAR-FRIENDLY TITLES (CRITICAL, users scan these on a calendar grid)
- Title ≤ 28 characters, action-first, and specific enough to recognize at a glance.
- Lead with a concrete verb + object. Good: "mew 15m", "minox AM", "scalp microneedle", "pillowcase swap", "pre-workout cals". Bad: "AM Routine", "Midday Tip", "Reminder", "Hydration".
- Never reuse the same title twice in one day. Distinguish AM vs PM vs reapply (e.g. "cerave + bha AM", "differin PM").
- Never prefix with the time, the calendar already shows it.
- No stiff "Category: Name — 2:22pm" patterns. Lowercase is fine.

## VOICE (CRITICAL, titles + descriptions become text reminders)

## SPECIFICITY (CRITICAL, use every piece of USER CONTEXT above)
- Descriptions MUST reference the user's actual concern, tier, scan finding, or stack, not generic advice. "reapply SPF, you're fair-skinned and outside today" beats "reapply SPF".
- If USER HISTORY shows past completion ≥80%, ramp intensity; if ≤50%, shorten / simplify / push morning tasks later.
- If past feedback exists, visibly respect it (e.g. user flagged "too many pings" → merge adjacent tasks; "too hard morning" → shift).
- For product tasks, name the specific brand/strength from the protocol. Never write "use your cleanser", write the product.
- If a piece of USER CONTEXT is missing, skip that tailoring, don't invent stats or history.

## PERSONALIZATION (HeightMax)
When building a HeightMax schedule, USE the user's age, sex, and height from USER CONTEXT:
- Age: affects growth-plate status (adults vs teens), recovery needs, and intensity
- Sex: affects typical frame, hormone context, and protocol emphasis
- Height: affects baseline and goal framing
Personalize task types, timing, and messaging accordingly.

## PERSONALIZATION (BoneMax)
When building a BoneMax schedule, USE the BoneMax profile lines in USER CONTEXT (workout frequency, TMJ history, mastic gum experience, heavy screen time):
- TMJ / jaw issues → conservative masseter and neck intensity; avoid stacking hard jaw work
- Heavy screen time → extra midday oral-posture / neck resets
- Higher workout days/week → place neck training after training days where possible
- Gum beginners → shorter mastic sessions with same form rules

## MINIMUM TASKS PER DAY (MANDATORY, do NOT generate fewer)

**Skinmax:** minimum **3** tasks/day (AM routine, midday micro-tip, PM routine). Typical day has **4–5** tasks when including SPF reapply and/or hydration check. Weekly adds exfoliation (replaces PM on chosen day) + pillowcase (Sunday). Monthly: progress photo + check-in on the 1st.

**HairMax (thinning/minoxidil stack):** minimum **4** tasks/day (finasteride or topical finasteride per user path, minoxidil AM, minoxidil PM, daily scalp micro-tip). Typical day has **4–5** tasks. Weekly: ketoconazole 2–3x/week on wash days; microneedling 1×/week (after month 4). Bi-weekly: progress photos. Monthly: check-in on the 1st.

**HairMax, NO HALLUCINATED SKIN ROUTINES:** Do **not** put SkinMax-only tasks (face SPF, face retinoid/Differin, generic **AM/PM face skincare** routines) on this schedule **unless** ACTIVE MODULE: SKINMAX is explicitly listed in MULTI-ACTIVE / combo sections. When HairMax runs alone, every task must be scalp/hair/wash/minox/fin/keto/photo/check-in, never a standalone \"AM Skincare Routine\" for the face.

**HairMax (non-thinning):** minimum **3** tasks/day (wash routine reminder or oil/mask on treatment days, daily scalp micro-tip, PM hair care). Weekly: wash day tasks per hair type frequency.

**HeightMax:** minimum **4** tasks/day (morning decompression, midday posture, evening decompression, sleep GH protocol). Typical: **5–7** with sprint days, nutrition, measurements.

**BoneMax:** minimum **4** tasks/day (mewing morning, midday oral posture, masseter/chew, mewing night). Typical: **5–7** with fascia, neck, nutrition, symmetry.

**FitMax:** minimum **3** tasks on rest days (morning nutrition, midday tip, evening closeout). Workout days: **5–6** (add pre-workout, post-workout, supplements). Weekly: weigh-in. Monthly: body check.

CRITICAL: If the notification engine reference specifies particular tasks as MANDATORY DAILY (e.g. Skinmax AM + midday + PM, or HairMax minoxidil AM + PM), you MUST include them every single day. A schedule with only 1–2 tasks/day is WRONG. go back and re-read the notification engine reference and add all required tasks.

## MULTI-WEEK CADENCE (REQUIRED, you are generating **{num_days}** consecutive days)

`day_number` 1 = first calendar day (today in the user's timezone). **Do not** pack weekly/biweekly/monthly items only into days 1–7; repeat them on the correct **weekdays and calendar dates** through day {num_days}.

- **Skinmax:** Exfoliation PM on the user's exfoliation weekday **every week** in range. Sunday midday: pillowcase line (or merge into Sunday tip). **Every calendar 1st** in range: progress photo (midday) + routine check-in (PM + 30 min).
- **HairMax (thinning stack):** Ketoconazole **2–3×/week** on fixed wash weekdays throughout. Microneedling **once per week** on the user's microneedling weekday (not same night as minoxidil); omit until month 4+ if ramp says so. **Bi-weekly progress photos** (e.g. every 14 days from day 1). **Every 1st:** monthly check-in (midday).
- **HairMax (non-thinning):** Wash / treatment days on a repeating weekly pattern matching hair-type frequency.
- **HeightMax:** Sprint pattern and **weekly height measure** on the same weekday each week (e.g. Sunday). **Every 1st:** monthly review when in range.
- **BoneMax:** **Weekly** checkpoint (e.g. Monday): front/side progress snap or symmetry review. **Every 1st:** monthly bone check when in range.
- **FitMax:** **Weekly weigh-in** on the same weekday each week. **Every 1st:** monthly body check when phase allows.

Use `task_type` **`checkpoint`** for weekly/biweekly/monthly items. Keep descriptions short if needed so JSON stays valid for long horizons.

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Create a schedule for {num_days} days (include **every** day from 1 through {num_days} in the `days` array).
2. Use the protocol and schedule rules for this maxx, not skincare assumptions unless the protocol explicitly says so.
3. Schedule morning tasks shortly after wake time and evening tasks with enough runway before sleep to actually get done.
4. Spread weekly or higher-intensity tasks across different days, and **repeat** them each week (or every 14 days for bi-weekly) across the full {num_days}-day window.
5. If the protocol involves outside exposure reminders, only add them when outside_today is true (Skinmax: follow outdoor_frequency rules in the Skinmax notification engine, not the same as this bullet for other maxxes).
6. Morning entry: follow MULTI-ACTIVE-MODULES above. If none, include one short morning check-in at wake time; if multi-module rules apply, do NOT duplicate a generic wake/good-morning SMS, stagger or use the first concrete task only. **Exception, Skinmax:** do NOT add a generic wake check-in; the AM routine at wake+15 is the first ping (unless another active module already owns wake, then stagger per MULTI-ACTIVE-MODULES). **Exception, BoneMax:** mewing morning reset at **wake** is the first ping. **Exception, HeightMax:** morning decompression at **wake+20** is the first HeightMax ping (merge with other modules per cross-module instructions when needed). **Exception, HairMax (thinning stack):** do NOT use a generic wake-only check-in; first pings are **finasteride (if oral path)** and/or **minoxidil at wake+15** per ramp phase (merge AM with Skinmax per HAIRMAX+SKINMAX when both active). **Exception, FitMax:** do NOT use a generic wake-only check-in; first daily FitMax anchor is **morning nutrition at wake+30** (merge with Skinmax AM when both active); on workout days add **pre-workout at workout−30m** (not a duplicate wake ping).
7. Each task must have: task_id (uuid), time (HH:MM in 24h), title, description, task_type (routine/reminder/checkpoint), duration_minutes.
8. task_type "routine" = core habit block, "reminder" = cue or anti-habit push, "checkpoint" = weekly treatment, harder session, or review.
9. Keep daily routines consistent but vary weekly treatments, sprint sessions, and review tasks across days.
10. Avoid stacking duplicate notification intent at the same clock time as generic pings the user may already get from another module (the system dedupes SMS, but schedules should still be sensible).
11. Include brief motivational messages for each day.
12. **IMPORTANT:** Every day MUST have at least the minimum number of tasks specified above. Read the NOTIFICATION ENGINE reference and include ALL mandatory daily tasks it lists. Short schedules with 1–2 tasks/day are wrong.
13. Task descriptions should include specific product names, step-by-step instructions, or actionable copy from the notification engine reference, not vague one-liners.
14. **SMS / push tone:** Titles and descriptions are used as the basis for text reminders. Write like a casual text from Max, not a dashboard. **Do not** use stiff patterns like `Category: Name — 2:22pm` or `Midday Tip: Hydration Goal` in titles. Prefer short titles (e.g. `water check`, `PM routine`, `sprint warm-up`) and put the real detail in **description** as plain, conversational sentences (lowercase ok). The app shows exact times; SMS copy should read like a normal reminder text (no explicit time prefix).

## OUTPUT FORMAT
Return ONLY valid JSON matching this structure (no markdown fences).
Each day should have **at least 3–5 tasks** (more for full-stack modules). The example below is abbreviated, your actual output must include ALL mandatory daily tasks per the notification engine reference.
