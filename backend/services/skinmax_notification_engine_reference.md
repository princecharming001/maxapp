# SKINMAX NOTIFICATION ENGINE, AI Reference (authoritative for schedule generation + SMS / task copy)

Use this document with **USER CONTEXT** from onboarding (wake, bed, skin type, primary/secondary concern, routine level, outdoor frequency, dietary restrictions). Do not invent intake questions the app does not collect; personalize **task titles, descriptions, and timing** from the fields you receive.

---

## USER INPUTS (collected at onboarding)

- Wake time (e.g. 7:00 AM)
- Bed time (e.g. 11:00 PM)
- Skin type: oily / dry / combo / normal
- Primary concern: acne / pigmentation / texture / redness / aging
- Secondary concern: optional, same options
- Routine level: none / basic / intermediate
- Outdoor frequency: always / sometimes / rarely
- Dietary restrictions opted in: dairy / sugar / seed oils (any combo or none)

Optional fields the backend may pass when known: `outside_today`, `skin_hydration_notifications`, `exfoliation_weekday`, retinoid start date / weeks on retinoid (for ramp and purge messaging).

---

## TIMING LOGIC, when notifications fire

All times are **computed from wake and bed**. Nothing is a generic “morning” or “night” without deriving from the user’s schedule.

- **AM Routine**, **15 minutes after wake** (time to get to the bathroom). Example: wake 7:00 → AM 7:15.
- **SPF Reapply**, **3 hours after AM Routine**. Only if outdoor setting is **always** or **sometimes**. If **always**, schedule every day. If **sometimes**, use “Going outside today?” logic and `outside_today` when known; only schedule reapply when appropriate. If **rarely**, **never** schedule SPF reapply.
- **Midday Tip**, **midpoint between AM Routine time and PM Routine time** (keeps the tip centered in the active day).
- **Hydration Check**, **2 hours after Midday Tip**. Omit entirely if user disabled hydration (`skin_hydration_notifications` false).
- **PM Routine**, **60 minutes before bed** (products absorb before pillow). Example: bed 11:00 PM → PM 10:00 PM.
- **Restriction Reminder**, **at most once per day**, at **one** estimated meal slot: **wake+1h**, **wake+5h**, or **wake+9h** (breakfast / lunch / dinner). Vary which slot day-to-day so it does not feel robotic. If multiple restrictions are opted in, **rotate which restriction** you mention, **never all three in one day**.
- **Weekly Exfoliation**, user’s chosen weekday (default **Wednesday**) at **PM Routine** time; that night **replaces** normal PM. **Never retinoid + exfoliant same night.** For acne/texture peels, avoid scheduling exfoliation the night **before or after** a retinoid night when possible.
- **Pillowcase Reminder**, every **Sunday** at **Midday Tip** time.
- **Monthly Progress Photo**, **1st of month** at **Midday Tip** time.
- **Monthly Routine Check-in**, **1st of month**, **30 minutes after PM Routine** time.
- **Quiet hours**, **no** notifications between **bed time and wake time** (handle midnight wrap in user timezone).

### Adherence (do not over-nag)

- User may **snooze 30 minutes** or **skip today** on any routine, **no follow-up nag** for that skipped task.
- If the user **does not log AM routine** by **AM slot + 2 hours**, **do not** send a chase reminder; they already know.

## PM ROUTINE, Retinoid Night vs Rest Night (automatic)

Every PM is **either** Retinoid Night **or** Rest Night from the **retinoid ramp** below. The user does not pick; encode the correct variant in `title` and `description`.

### PM skin type modifiers (retinoid nights)

- **Dry:** always use buffer (moisturizer before retinoid) regardless of routine level.
- **Oily:** skip seal/oil; lighter moisturizer.
- **Combo:** buffer on dry zones only.

## RETINOID RAMP SCHEDULE, how to choose retinoid vs rest

Track from **retinoid start date** when available; otherwise assume “not started” until onboarding indicates otherwise.

- **Redness concern:** **No retinoid** until **4+ weeks** of barrier-only routine **and** user **opts in**. Until then, **every night = rest night**.
- **Not started retinoid:** **all rest nights**; you may **suggest** starting after **2+ weeks** on a stable basic routine.
- **Weeks 1–2:** retinoid **Mon + Thu** only (2×/week).
- **Weeks 3–4:** retinoid **Mon, Wed, Fri** (3×/week).
- **Weeks 5–8:** retinoid **every other night** (alternate automatically).
- **Week 9+:** retinoid **nightly** unless user pauses / irritation.
- **Override:** **Exfoliation day = always rest night** (never retinoid + exfoliant same night).

### Purge reassurance (~14 days after retinoid start)

Schedule **one** checkpoint-style reminder with copy along these lines: *“Purging is normal during weeks 2–6 on retinoids. Weak skin cells are pushing out faster, that often means it’s working. Don’t quit. If it’s severe, drop to every 3rd night and tell me in chat.”*

---

## WEEKLY EXFOLIATION (replaces PM that night)

At **PM Routine** time on the chosen weekday.

- **Acne:** The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, **10 min max**, rinse, moisturizer only. Skip if inflamed. Not night before/after retinoid.
- **Pigmentation / Aging:** The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution, cotton pad, leave on, moisturize. Not a retinoid night.
- **Texture:** Same peel as acne; **not** same week as microneedling session if user does face microneedling.
- **Redness:** The Inkey List PHA Toner, only if **4+ weeks** stable barrier; if flare in last week, use **rest night** instead.

---

## MIDDAY MICRO-TIPS, rotating 7-day cycle (one per day)

Use as **Midday Tip** task body; same rotation for all concerns.

- **Monday:** Hands off your face, bacteria transfer causes breakouts.
- **Tuesday:** Water check, aim for ~3L today. Dehydrated skin looks dull and textured.
- **Wednesday:** Change your pillowcase this week? Dirty fabric causes breakouts and irritation.
- **Thursday:** Wipe your phone screen, it touches your face more than you think.
- **Friday:** Stressed today? Cortisol spikes can flare skin. Take 5 deep breaths.
- **Saturday:** Wearing sunglasses? They protect the thinnest skin on your face from UV.
- **Sunday:** Check your diet today, inflammatory foods often show on skin within 24–48 hours.

---

## RESTRICTION REMINDERS (max 1/day if opted in)

Rotate copy if multiple restrictions:

- **Dairy:** Dairy can spike IGF-1 and trigger breakouts, check what’s in your meal.
- **Sugar:** Added sugar drives inflammation, often shows on skin within ~48 hours.
- **Seed oils:** Many seed oils are pro-inflammatory in excess, check what you’re cooking with or ordering.

---

## COMBO CONCERNS (primary + secondary)

**Primary** drives retinoid choice and overall PM structure. **Secondary** adds an AM active only if **no conflict**.

**Conflict rules**

- BHA and retinoid: **never same session**, BHA AM, retinoid PM.
- AHA peel and retinoid: **never same night**, exfoliation day = rest night.
- Vitamin C and niacinamide: **OK**, layer **vitamin C first**.
- Azelaic acid and retinoid: **OK**, AM or rest nights.
- Benzoyl peroxide and retinoid: **never same session**, BP on rest nights or AM only.
- Microneedling over **active acne:** **never**, only clear, scarred areas.

**Examples**

- **Acne + Pigmentation:** AM BHA then Alpha Arbutin; PM retinoid night tretinoin; rest night azelaic.
- **Acne + Texture:** AM BHA + niacinamide; PM tretinoin; rest BP spot.
- **Pigmentation + Aging:** AM vitamin C + Alpha Arbutin + HA; PM tretinoin; rest HA + squalane.
- **Redness + Acne:** First 4 weeks barrier (redness protocol); then AM azelaic, PM adapalene **slow** ramp from 1×/week.
- **Redness + Aging:** 4 weeks barrier; then AM vitamin C if tolerated; PM tretinoin 0.025% sandwich from 1×/week.
- **Texture + Pigmentation:** AM vitamin C + Alpha Arbutin; PM 0.05% tretinoin; rest azelaic; microneedling when no active acne.

---

## MONTHLY CHECK-IN (1st of month, PM + 30 min)

Ask: **“Been ~30 days, how’s your skin? Better / Same / Worse”**

- **Better:** Keep the current plan. If still on retinoid ramp, advance to the next stage when appropriate. Next check in ~30 days.
- **Same + on routine < 8 weeks:** Most actives need **8–12 weeks**, too early to overhaul; stay consistent.
- **Same + 8+ weeks on routine:** Suggest **one** upgrade: retinoid step/frequency, missing AM active, weekly exfoliation if not doing it, or vitamin C if missing.
- **Worse + within ~6 weeks of retinoid start:** Likely **purge**, normal weeks 2–6; drop retinoid to **1×/week**; if not better in 2 weeks, pause retinoid and simplify.
- **Worse + past 6 weeks on retinoid OR not on retinoid:** **Barrier reset:** 2 weeks **cleanser + moisturizer + SPF only**; then re-introduce actives one at a time.
