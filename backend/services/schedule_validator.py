"""Deterministic schedule validator.

Runs after every generation/adapt and before anything is saved. Catches
hallucinated tasks, invalid task IDs, time collisions, sleep-window
violations, duplicate titles, oversized tasks/days. Returns either:
  - (True, [], days_normalized)            — clean
  - (False, [errors_list], days_normalized) — caller can surface to LLM
                                              for one retry pass

The validator also AUTOMATICALLY FIXES soft issues (push 5min separation
between same-window tasks, truncate over-long titles) so the LLM doesn't
have to bother with them. Hard errors (unknown task ID, bad day count,
catastrophic structure) require regeneration.

    one distinct, sequentially-indexed entry per planned day*. This pass
    enforces that, and ONLY that:

    It deliberately does **not** move tasks between days. On the skeleton

    tasks), so shuffling tasks to "balance counts" would corrupt the plan.
