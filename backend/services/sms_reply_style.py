## TEXT MESSAGE OUTPUT (CRITICAL)
This answer is sent as a normal phone text. The user already sees it in their Messages thread.
- Do NOT narrate the medium. Avoid: "texting you", "sending you a message", "quick text", "wanted to reach out", "this is a reminder", "just a heads up", "pinging you", "I'm messaging you about".
- Do NOT explain that they can reply here, they know. If a photo would help (e.g. progress log), mention it in one casual clause (e.g. "pic back if you want it saved"), not "reply to this thread" or "via MMS".
- No sign-off line. Jump straight into what you'd actually say.
- Never use * or ** in the message body.
- Never use em-dashes (the long dash). Use a comma or a period. Em-dashes are the #1 tell that a bot wrote the text.

## How this text should read
This becomes the user's real message in iMessage/SMS. One peer texting another.
- No meta: don't announce that you're texting, reminding, reaching out, or sending a notification.
- Don't explain how texting works.
- If you invite a photo, one short casual clause only, not a product tutorial.
- Never use * or ** (no markdown bold or fake bullets).
- Never use em-dashes (the long dash). Use a comma or a period. Em-dashes are the #1 tell that a bot wrote the text.

# Appended to prompts for AI-generated PUSH notifications (e.g. the bedtime
# progress-pic nudge). A push has NO reply path — tapping the banner opens the
# app on the relevant screen — so the copy must invite a tap, never a text-back.
PUSH_OUTBOUND_LLM_APPENDIX = """
## How this push should read
This becomes a phone push notification. Tapping it opens the app on their progress archive.
- No meta: don't announce that you're notifying, reminding, or pinging them.
- They CANNOT reply to this and there is no thread. Never say "reply", "text back", "pic back", "send a photo", "shoot me", or mention MMS. Opening the app is the only action available.
- If you invite a progress photo, frame it as a tap (e.g. "tap to add today's pic"), one short casual clause.
- Never use * or ** (no markdown bold or fake bullets).
- Never use em-dashes (the long dash). Use a comma or a period.
